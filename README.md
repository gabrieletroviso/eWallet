# eWallet

This is a beta version of a really simple wallet application.

With this Android app, developed in AndroidStudio and written in Java, you can track monthly expenses and incomes through daily entries. You can set the value, type, date and description for each transaction. There are three types of expenses: "Necessaria" (necessary), "Superflua" (unnenecessary) and Extra; and two types of income: "Stipendio" (salary) and "Altro" (other). You can view all transactions for each month, including value, type and date. From this view, you can delete transactions or edit their properties.

Furthermore, eWallet compiles all data to show an annual balance plot, an annual cumulative balance plot, and statistics such as annual expenses/income percentages, avarage necessary expenses and the annual balance avarage. Statistics are displayed through two pie charts and a dedicated panel

Finally, there is a section to manage DB (which is local DB called "eWalletDB").

This is a personal exercise project. If you download and use this repo, please note:

- You may encounter errors and bugs.
- Labels and graphic elements are in Italian and may lack proper design refinement.
- Comments in the code may contain errors in English.

I hope this code can be useful to someone.
